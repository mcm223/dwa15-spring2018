**Spring 2018**: Before completing these instructions, Mac users need to update to the latest version of MAMP as it includes an updated version of PHP (v7.2.1) which we'll need. To do that, [read this post in the Issues forum...](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-spring2018/issues/12).

# Composer setup on Mac

These instructions are for Mac users; [for Windows instructions on setting up Composer, go here...](/laravel/composer-windows.md)

## Summary
1. PHP from command line check
2. Installing Composer
3. Common problems (and solutions)


## PHP from command line check
In addition to running PHP on a server, you can also run PHP from command line. Composer uses PHP from command line, so we want to first get on the same page with *which* installation of PHP command line is using in order to understand what version of PHP we're using, what modules we have available, etc.

We want PHP from command line to use MAMP's installation of PHP, located at: `/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.1/bin/`

This is accomplished by adding the above paths to your PATH variable. __For complete instructions on what the PATH variable is and how to edit it, read: [PATH Variables](/command-line/path.md).__

Once you've completed the above linked instructions, you should confirm that...

1. You can run `php` from the command line.
2. The command `php` is using the PHP executable that comes installed with MAMP/XAMPP.

__Expectations:__

```xml
$ which php
/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.1/bin/php
```

```xml
$ php -v
PHP 7.2.1 (cli) (built: Jan 15 2018 12:20:50) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies
```

```xml
$ php --ini
Configuration File (php.ini) Path: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.1/conf
Loaded Configuration File:         /Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/conf/php7.2.1.ini
Scan for additional .ini files in: (none)
Additional .ini files parsed:      (none)
```

## Installing Composer on Mac
*Note: In the following steps, we'll be prefixing most of our commands with `sudo` which will run the commands as an administrator. Depending on your system, this might not be necessary, but it won't hurt to include it.*

Move into your `/usr/local/bin` directory. This is a common location to put command line executable programs, so we'll install Composer here.

```xml
$ sudo cd /usr/local/bin
```

Note: On some versions of OSX the `/usr` directory does not exist by default. If you receive the error */usr/local/bin: No such file or directory* then you must create the directory manually using this command
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
```

Once in `/usr/local/bin`, download and install `composer.phar`:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php
```

What a .phar file is:
>> *The phar extension provides a way to put entire PHP applications into a single file called a &ldquo;phar&rdquo; (PHP Archive) for easy distribution and installation.* -[source](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.phar.php)

After running the above command to download/install `composer.phar` you should see a message saying that Composer was successfully installed.

```
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php
Password:
All settings correct for using Composer
Downloading...

Composer successfully installed to: /usr/local/bin/composer.phar
Use it: php composer.phar
```

Once install is complete, to make calling Composer easier, rename `composer.phar` to `composer` using the `mv` (move) command:

```bash
$ sudo mv composer.phar composer
```

Test it works:

```bash
$ composer
```

You should see something similar to this output (except the version # will reflect whatever the current version of Composer is):

## Common problems

### Issue: openssl

__Symptoms:__ You get a message saying *openssl* is not enabled.

__Solution:__ Identify what `php.ini` file you're using with this command:

	$ php --ini

Open the indicated `php.ini` file and make sure the following line is not commented out (i.e. it does *not* have a semi-colon in front of it):

	extension=php_openssl.dll


### Issue: SSL Certificate problem

__Symptoms:__ When downloading Composer (via the `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` command), you receive an error regarding SSL certificates:

```xml
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
```

__Solution__:
Run the curl command somewhere outside of `/usr/local/bin` (for example, in your Documents folder) and when it's done, move the resulting `composer.phar` into `/usr/local/bin`.

```xml
$ cd ~/Documents
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer.phar
```
